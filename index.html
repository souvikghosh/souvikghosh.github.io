My name is Souvik Ghosh and I'm a graduate student in Electrical Engineering from San Diego State University where
I have studied a range of modules including High Speed Networks, Wireless Sensor Networks and  Modem Design. 
Data analysis also interests me, which is why recently, I have taken to data mining projects and plan on doing more in
the future.<br>
