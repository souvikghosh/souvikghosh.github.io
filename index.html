My name is Souvik Ghosh and I'm a graduate student in Electrical Engineering from San Diego State University where
I have studied a range of modules including High Speed Networks, Wireless Sensor Networks and  Modem Design. 
Data analysis also interests me, which is why recently, I have taken to data mining projects and plan on doing more in
the future.<br><br>

<b>Python</b> is my preferred languge for programming, especially because of its modules for languaue processing(<b>nltk</b>),
machine learning(<b>scikit learn</b>), data analysis(<b>pandas</b>) and various APIs (<b>tweepy</b>). Also Python's minimal complexity and DRY principle, leads to
much faster development.<br><br>

Some of my code is on my GitHub and for more information about my professional experience check out my LinkedIn profile.<br><br>
