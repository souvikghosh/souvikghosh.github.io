Electrical engineer by specialization, also interested in data analytics. My projects are a reflection of my interests which include embedded systems coding and lately data mining. Education details are as follows:

###Interests

Hardware and software interaction always fascinates me, which actually made me opt for Masters in Electrical Engineering. This interest was the reason for my bachelors degree final year project "GSM based voting system". This is a simplistic approach to a very expensive process in India, Voting.
